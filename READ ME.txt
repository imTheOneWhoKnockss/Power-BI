
Shopping online is currently the need of the hour. Because of this COVID, it's not easy to walk in a store randomly and buy anything you want. 

Using this dataset, I have created a report on a single page with various visualization like Stacked Bar Chart, Stacked Column Chart, Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Cards and A map.


Customers Analysis - 

- Profile the customers based on their frequency of purchase - calculate frequency of     purchase for each customer
- Do the high frequent customers are contributing more revenue
- Are they also profitable - what is the profit margin across the buckets
- Which customer segment is most profitable in each year.
- How the customers are distributed across the countries- -

Product Analysis - 

- Which country has top sales?
- Which are the top 5 profit-making product types on a yearly basis
- How is the product price varying with sales - Is there any increase in sales with the      decrease in price at a day level
- What is the average delivery time across the counties - bar plot
